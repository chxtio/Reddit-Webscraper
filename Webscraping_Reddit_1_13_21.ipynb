I was hoping to provide a default server and key in it but apparently I was banned on mailgun. Hopefully in the near future I can get this running on plain stmp however I would have to own a server.

Sorry for my english btw.\\n\\nI always wanted to work as a programmer and today I made a big step for my hopefully new job.\\n\\nI am currently working as a network engineer. But in my company that means you mostly do first and second level suppport. That's soooo fucking boring. 95% of the time you don't have to use your brain. Most of the time people just delete the internet and you have to put the wifi cable back in the computer. At the end it made me sick, so I decided to try something.\\n\\nSo after struggling very long and not knowing what to do... today I asked my boss, if i could work in another team as a programmer. He was totally fine with it and wants to help me changing teams asap. I thnik he was more afraid, that i leave the company, so it was nice for him, that i just want to change teams. But i'm so happy right now.\\n\\nOverall i'm still a bit afraid. I had many programming courses in college, but i never did a real project. I understand basics of programming and databases and i'm able to write simple things. I really hope thats enough for the first part.\\n\\nWish me luck guys!</td>\n",

It's something I struggled very much with, as I kept learning more and more about programming, data structures and algorithms, new and shiny technologies \\[insert javascript joke here\\], [flipping through many C++ books](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list), and so on...\\n\\nWell, not anymore! I built my first website which uses a handful of technologies and solves a problem that I have as an undergrad engineering student: doing calculations with uncertainties. If you want to take a look into the website, [here's the link](https://scicalc-rs.herokuapp.com/). I can't overstate how much this subreddit(and many other subs, such as /r/rust and /r/programminglanguages) helped me. Now, read on for more goodies on how I did it and maybe you'll be motivated to build a *real app* too^(1)!\\n\\nI just wanted to share my excitement and some pieces of knowledge about the app that I made.\\n\\nFirst, the problem: in engineering undergrad, we have to make lab reports, which involve making all sorts of measurements. In chemistry, you have to measure volume, mass, pressure, temperature and so on... In physics, you may also measure lengths, time, etc. Depending on your instrument's precision, the error involved in making such measurements will vary. The usual notation for those measurements is `(x ± y) u.m.`. So, for example, when measuring a person's height with measuring tape, you might get `(1.75 ± 0.01) m` . Then you have to do operations with these quantities. There's a whole theory regarding these measurements, which involve a lot of statistics and calculus. But I won't bore you with the details. [Here's a good starting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty), if you're curious. Anyways, knowing how to do operations with these measurements, we're good right? Just pick a good ol' calculator and...\\n\\n[Oh wow! Really?](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\sigma_{xy}&space;\\approx&space;xy&space;\\cdot&space;\\sqrt{&space;\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x}{x}&space;\\right&space;)^2&space;+&space;\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_y}{y}&space;\\right)^2&space;}) Do all of that just for multiplicating two numbers? Hell naw... I need to automate this!\\n\\nSo yeah, that problem really was asking for a programming solution. Again, I'll spare the details, but making this online calculator involved roughly **three main parts**:\\n\\n* The front-end, which is the part that the user sees. The part that we care about is making a form which the user has to fill up and send to a web server(yes, the calculator is server-side, not client-side). **This part involves knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript.**\\n* The web server, which handles the request from the user and passes it to a binary program. This is something that I may change in the future, but currently, the server uses Node.js with the express framework to do all of the heavy-lifting regarding HTTP requests, parsing form data, and so on. Once a request comes in, it's immediately used in a child process, which executes a pre-compiled rust binary, based on the correspondingly-named crate [scicalc-rs](https://crates.io/crates/scicalc-rs). The binary then prints it's text output(simple stdout output), which get's sent back to the user. **This part involves knowledge of Node.js, express, HTTP requests, javascript(again),** [**and much more...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/wiki/faq)\\n* *The actual calculator program*, which by far was the hardest part. I mean, at the start of this project, I had *no idea* how hard it was to parse a simple expression like `(1.00 ± 0.01)`. Even now I still think that parsing is black magic that programmers use to make computers understand human language. Anyways, the program is actually quite elaborate, but it's functionality can be described by this sequence: *read text -> transform it into a meaningful expression -> evaluate the expression -> print the value(or a message in case of error)*. You can read more about it on the project's [repository](https://github.com/vini-fda/scicalc-rs)(I fully encourage you to take a look at the README, I even included a handful of resources ~~I shamefully copied from~~ that were REALLY helpful). **This part involves knowledge of rust, some programming language theory, data structures and algorithms(honestly this is everywhere, but most prominent here), and** [practical know-how of making parsers](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)\\n\\nAnd honestly, that's not even the full picture. How did I actually manage to make the code run in a web server? Is the server hosted on my machine? Definitely no. I had to use an online service called **heroku** to serve the app(to be clear, I could have used many other alternatives, such as kubernetes, AWS and so on...). But I also had to containerize my app, which pretty much means what you'd expect: run it in an isolated container(kind of a virtual machine), with its own environment variables and build set up(with the app containerized, it was really easy to get my scicalc-rs crate and install it on the container, then run the installed binary from Node). For this I had to learn how to use **docker**, which wasn't really fun, but opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me: namely, the field of **DevOps**, which concerns quality assurance, CI/CD, security, etc. Also, for completeness' sake, I had to use a version control system(in my case, **git**), to keep my project manageable, track versions (and maybe, in the future, collaborate with other users, by revisioning pull requests, for example).\\n\\nWhew, that was quite a journey! And definitely a fun one. I could not have done this without the **human** element: people on reddit, stackoverflow, mozilla developer network, many many discord channels and forums that kept patiently answering questions, with detailed and thorough answers. THANK YOU to everyone that lends their time to share knowledge on the web, you all are the real MVPs.\\n\\nAnd finally, on a more introspective note, I could not have done this without me, my fully working brain. This is something that is often overlooked, especially in programming communities, but burnout, anxiety, shortness of attention span and many other problems plagued me during my \"learn programming\" journey, and may very well be affecting yours too. I can't count how many times I picked up a project just to bore myself out of it two weeks later. To be commited involves not only motivation, but also discipline and energy. *Be careful: learning programming is a daunting task, and you must devote many hours every day to get minimally good at it*. Nonetheless, practice IS NOT ENOUGH. You also have to relax, do other things that aren't mentally straining(watch your favourite show, draw, go for a jog, call your friends, etc). The Covid pandemic definitely makes this harder, but you can manage to do it(hell, I - a random stranger on the internet - did it, so *why can't you?*).\\n\\n^(1)Note: I assume you already read [this subreddit's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq), which is a godsend for all sorts of questions, particularly regarding the sort of problem I've described. I'm by no means a \"pioneer\" in facing and proposing solutions this problem. My intent is to share my particular journey, thus giving back to this community.</td>\n",

I'm following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8) to build a PERN stack to-do app and of course I get stuck on an error that doesn't happen in the tutorial.\\n\\n**PROBLEM:** After I connected the frontend to the backend, I tried submitting a question and ran into a CORS network error. React runs on port 3000 and Postgres runs on port 5000, but I'm already using CORS in my app, so AFAIK it should take care of that. I called CORS before I defined my routes, and I've looked over the MDN docs about CORS and [this error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSDidNotSucceed) and can't figure out why this isn't working. I'm using firefox, but I get similar errors on chrome.\\n\\nThe firefox dev console tells me:\\n\\n>*Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at* *http://localhost:5000/todos*\\*.

To be honest, I only wanted to make it a career because of my passion for video games so I picked up Gamemaker I got funded on KS about 2 years ago on KS, and realized I probably would need to take up a job since I wont be taking a cut of the cheese and would take care of my employees while also paying my own bills and cover local advertising costs.\\n\\nI got into web dev and it seemed pretty easy and fun too, got a very entry level job in it, and have been working there for the past year or 2, while learning and taking in everything. However the current job I'm at they don't seem to really follow modern web dev practices, but it did teach me everything I need to know to get started and make something from A - Z for front and backend albeit even if I don't make the UI designs majority of the time and use templates most of the time.\\n\\nI figured it was time to move on since it seems like I probably won't learn much more about the industry with my current employer nor will it improve my living conditions. So I got a reply back from a company which I had an interview today, I always heard that during the interview or technical part is where many people tend to fail.\\n\\nNOW: \\nThe Whole Interview happened over a google meets. Truth be told I feel like I did very poorly, aside from the fact that I was running on 4 hours of sleep, I didn't read the interviewers questions properly and made plenty of mistakes, granted the guy was nice and patient and allowed me to correct my mistakes while asking if I understood why my code didn't run. It also didn't help that I was insanely nervous and the 2 interviewers seemed like they were on a very strict and busy schedule.\\n---\\nEDIT: I Feel like I should explain why I only had 4 hours of sleep. Due to Covid, my job cut hours so I'm working a second overnight job to make ends meet, unfortunately don't have much of a choice for the time being and had to take some time out from sleeping to even make it to the interview. \\n---\\nAfter a bit of the technical part the CEO got a call on his phone and told me he wanted to talk more about the company. He Showed me the Software and his backend and explained to me the process step by step of his business and what kind of work he expects, it seems he's only got 1 developer currently running everything and needs another guy to delegate the tasks.\\n\\nAfter He Explained everything he asked If I had any questions, which I asked more about his in house software , the location of the job , and if the job was remote. I told him that if he were to hire me I'd have to give a 2 weeks notice for my other 2 jobs that I'm currently working which he did not seem happy about but If I I were to work remotely I can start immediately.\\n\\nHe left after answering my questions and Told me to follow up with him at the end of the week through Phone. I was left alone with the guy conducting the technical aspects, I was able to correct my other mistakes but the second and third examples is where I messed up on, and again asked if I knew what I had done wrong. After a few seconds I explained to Him why my code messed up and asked if he understood what I meant, to which he promptly replied \"Not really but it seems that you get it for the most part, I have to go now so I'll talk with you later\".\\n\\nHe offered me to look through to google the answer, but I was determined to try and solve it myself, I realize the joke of stack overflow , but I felt like if I couldn't do it myself then I def wasn't ready to enter the company maybe it was a mistake not to.\\n\\nI emailed both the CEO and the Technical Interviewer back thanking them for their time and apologized for the mistakes, I sent them the fixed working code as well.\\n\\nBut I was left with a very dreaded feeling in my stomach. It just feels like I'm not cut out for it and doubts began to wash in, asking if I could ever even enter that industry with my limited knowledge and skills. If you want to know, I later researched the interview question and it was called the \"two sum\" question, which I used the brute force method instead of the more advanced , cleaner and faster stuff shown in the answers.\\n\\nSorry for the vent and rant. Just wanted to know if anyone else felt the way and what they did to cope with it. Although I have the employers number I'm very doubtful I'll get the job due to my failures.</td>\n",

I am very proud of the project, which is unnecessary to mention honestly, because In my opinion software engineering is a craft, and you should be proud of every published project of yours, otherwise it is below your standards and should not be published.\\n\\nThe main design points of the project are code quality, performance, extensibility. I know code quality may not be a design point, since many programmers live in an ideological echo-chamber and they only think their code is of high quality truly believing it, but still, I would like to mention it, since that's something I have been focusing on.\\n\\nDocumentation, features, and usage examples of the library are present in the README in the repository, as well as features to be implemented. The biggest feature to implement currently is an async logger and a meta logger(structured logger).\\n\\nI have done benchmarks against spdlog, and you can take a look at them in the README in the repository\\n\\nI would be very glad and honored if you drop a critique, an opinion, an idea, or want to contribute to the project: [https://github.com/ChristianPanov/lwlog](https://github.com/ChristianPanov/lwlog)\\n\\nAlso, feel free to star the project if you find it interesting and of enough quality for usage, that way you will help it get shown to people more often.\\n\\nNOTE: Issue #9 is already fixed in my local repo, since it's of critical importance for using the logger in a meaningful way\\n\\nThank you for your time</td>\n",
